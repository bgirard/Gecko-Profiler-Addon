/**
 * ProgressReporter
 *
 * This class is used by long-winded tasks to report progress to observers.
 * If a task has subtasks that want to report their own progress, these
 * subtasks can have their own progress reporters which are hooked up to the
 * parent progress reporter, resulting in a tree structure. A parent progress
 * reporter will calculate its progress value as a weighted sum of its
 * subreporters' progress values.
 *
 * A progress reporter has a state, an action, and a progress value.
 *
 *  - state is one of STATE_WAITING, STATE_DOING and STATE_FINISHED.
 *  - action is a string that describes the current task.
 *  - progress is the progress value as a number between 0 and 1.
 *
 * A progress reporter starts out in the WAITING state. The DOING state is
 * entered with the begin method which also sets the action. While the task is
 * executing, the progress value can be updated with the setProgress method.
 * When a task has finished, it can call the finish method which is just a
 * shorthand for setProgress(1); this will set the state to FINISHED.
 *
 * Progress observers can be added with the addListener method which takes a
 * function callback. Whenever the progress value or state change, all
 * listener callbacks will be called with the progress reporter object. The
 * observer can get state, progress value and action by calling the getter
 * methods getState(), getProgress() and getAction().
 *
 * Creating child progress reporters for subtasks can be done with the
 * addSubreporter(s) methods. If a progress reporter has subreporters, normal
 * progress report functions (setProgress and finish) can no longer be called.
 * Instead, the parent reporter will listen to progress changes on its
 * subreporters and update its state automatically, and then notify its own
 * listeners.
 * When adding a subreporter, you are expected to provide an estimated
 * duration for the subtask. This value will be used as a weight when
 * calculating the progress of the parent reporter.
